    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The global crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic has created widespread disruption. Apart from a crisis in the healthcare sector, there has alsobeen serious economic consequences. Financial institutions, in particular, are exposed to severe economic downturnssince a large volume of their business involveslending money which needs to be repaid.Rather than relying on low skilled and poorly paid banking officials to make loan decisions, new technology enables more accurate predictionsthrough the use of AI and appropriate datasets of client information.This transformation in financial services, coupled with new machine learning models and frameworks have created an opportunity for your start-up software development company to develop applications to address a potential tsunami of loan defaults on new business.Your company has been approached by a USbankand tasked with the development of a bespoke prototypesystem which predicts the likelihood of its customers defaulting on new loans taken out.As part of the negotiations with the company, you have retained the IP and may use it in future projects.</p>
